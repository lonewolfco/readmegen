# ReadMeGen
ReadMeGen is a command line application that does the legwork for developers when it comes to generating a ReadMe file for their source projects on GitHub so developers can spend more time building their projects. 

ReadMeGen will help the user build a dynamic ReadMe file containing the following key points:
- What the App is used For
- How to use the app
- How to install the app
- How to Report Issues
- How to make Contributions

In order to utilize ReadMeGen, the user will interact with the generator via node.js by entering the syntax node index.js on an integrated terminal.


## UI & Video Walkthrough of Application
Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.


Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.

Walkthrough Video: 27%
A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the README generator must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.

The walkthrough video must demonstrate a generated README that matches the user input and has a functioning table of contents.
